# American-Sign-Language-Classifier
Classifying Letters of the American Sign Language.

I used the **VGG16** network for transfer learning. 

I tried to use a scratch model but couldn't get the accuracy over 10%

## Requirements 

**Pytorch** and **Numpy**.

**OpenCV** is required for ASL-Detection.

You can find the installation instructions for **Numpy** [here](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)

And the one for **Pytoch** [here](https://pytorch.org)

And [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) is the github repo for **OpenCV** 


## Where to find dataset
I got the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet).

I split it into a train and test set but a validation set would also be useful.
